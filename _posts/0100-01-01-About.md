description: <h4 id="M4R">USAID GeoCenter Program</h4> <p>This mapping project directly supports agricultural programs in Bangladesh.</p> <p>As the lead foreign assistance agency for the US Government, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) implements programs to address food insecurity around the world. In Bangladesh, these programs are part of a whole-of-government initiative known as “Feed the Future.” USG agencies that contribute to the Feed the Future initiative work hand-in-hand with partner countries to develop their agriculture sectors, break the cycle of poverty and hunger, and promote prosperity and stability. The goal of Feed the Future is to reduce the prevalence of poverty and of stunted children by 20 percent in countries where the program is active.</p> <p>Data created from this mapping effort will be used by USAID and its partners who are working with rural farming villages in Bangladesh. It is intended to help communities in the Khulna District improve land management and increase agricultural production. </p>
